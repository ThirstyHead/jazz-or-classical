PRESENTATION: Do You Prefer Jazz or Classical?

Enough already! Your programming language is nice -- quite nice, I'm sure. So why are you so insistent that it's better than mine? Why are you so quick to gleefully point out my programming language's shortcomings and inconsistencies, and yet so defensive when I point out yours?

In this talk, Scott Davis (author/presenter of "Architecture of the MEAN Stack") does his best to talk about programming languages, frameworks, and paradigms without actually mentioning them by name. Instead, you'll find out if you prefer Jazz or Classical music. Scott's two decades as a Java developer, two decades as a JavaScript developer, and a lifetime of pretending to be a musician should help tease out interesting discussions about unexamined prejudices, false dichotomies, and the only acceptable type of music worth listening to.
